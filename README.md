My Personal Blog – Math, Robotics, BAC 2026, and Mental Healing

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet :DDD
This blog is a place where I document my journey as a 17-year-old Algerian Duck fighting through school pressure, mental battles, and the dream of becoming something meaningful in the world of math, programming, robotics, and technology, ..as well as games :PPPPP... with the intention of organizing all what I’m learning/discovering and make it available for others who may find it helpful 

Sincerly,
Your Friendly Duck 


Fun Fact: I actually hate my name as duck but I like it too, the reason I hate is because it's smth new for me: used to be called fish (Mrs Fish)/(silly sish) or sen (Senju)/(S-009) or even cat (silly cat/)(Cat 404), and why i like it is bcs it's new haha
